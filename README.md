Fountainhead
============

Contextual screenwriting environment that leverages the speed of [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) and the readability of [Fountain](http://fountain.io), enabling the user to just write.

Inspired by Jonathan Poritsky's [Fountain for Sublime Text](https://github.com/poritsky/fountain-sublime-text) package.

## Installation 

### Option A: Package Control
1. Install [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation).
2. Select **Package Control: Install Package** from `Tools > Command Palette` (⇧⌘P).
3. Select **Fountainhead**.

### Option B: GitHub
1. [Download the ZIP of this repository](https://github.com/derickc/Fountainhead/archive/master.zip) and uncompress it.
2. Move the uncompressed **Fountainhead** folder to the appropriate packages directory:
    - Mac OS X: `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/`
        - In Sublime Text 3 you can get to this directory by selecting: `Sublime Text > Preferences > Browse Packages...`
        - In the Finder you can get to the hidden **Library** directory by holding the `Option / Alt` key and selecting `Go > Library`
3. Launch **Sublime Text 3**.

## Quickstart

1. Open your Fountain file.
2. Verify that "Fountain" appears in the bottom right-hand corner.
    - If it doesn't, you can click on the offending syntax and change it to "Fountain", or you can use the menu: `View > Syntax > Open all with current extension as > Fountain`.
3. Write!
