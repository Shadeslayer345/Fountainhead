Fountainhead
============

Contextual screenwriting environment that leverages the speed of [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) and the readability of [Fountain](http://fountain.io), enabling the user to just write.

Inspired by Jonathan Poritsky's [Fountain for Sublime Text](https://github.com/poritsky/fountain-sublime-text) package.

Compatible with Sublime Text [2](http://www.sublimetext.com) and [3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3). Optimized for [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3).

## Installation 

### Option A: Package Control
1. Install [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation).
2. Select **Package Control: Install Package** from `Tools > Command Palette` (⇧⌘P).
3. Select **Fountainhead**.

### Option B: GitHub
1. [Download the ZIP of this repository](https://github.com/derickc/Fountainhead/archive/master.zip) and uncompress it.
2. Move the uncompressed **Fountainhead** folder to the appropriate packages directory:
    - In Sublime Text, select: `Sublime Text > Preferences > Browse Packages...`
