Fountainhead
============

Sublime Text 3 package that provides a screenwriting environment using the [Fountain](http://fountain.io) markup syntax.

Inspired by Jonathan Poritsky's [Fountain for Sublime Text](https://github.com/poritsky/fountain-sublime-text) package.

## Installation 

*Note: Works best with [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3).*

### Using Package Control:
1. Install [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation).
2. Select "Package Control: Install Package" from `Tools > Command Palette` (â‡§âŒ˜P).
3. Select "Fountainhead".




## Quickstart

1. Open your Fountain file.
2. Verify that "Fountainhead" appears in the bottom right-hand corner.
    - If it doesn't, you can click on the offending syntax and change it to "Fountainhead", or you can use the menu: `View > Syntax > Open all with current extension as >Fountainhead`.
3. Write!
