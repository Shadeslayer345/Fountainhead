Fountainhead 0.6.1 Changelog:

Fixed
 - Add missing ő and ű (Thanks to fricy for finding the issue).
 - Cleaned up Fountainhead.tmLanguage scene_headings scope to remove redundant capital letters (since the ?i regex makes it case insensitive).
 
Restart Sublime Text for the updates to be properly applied.
